[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zayenz/advent-of-code-2017.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zayenz/advent-of-code-2017)

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) 
advent calendar.

The solutions are organized as independent binary crates in a cargo
workspace.

## Warning

The solutions should not be viewed as idiomatic Rust code or even good code 
at all. They are mainly written to solve the problem at hand, and as a way
to learn more Rust.
